# Gradient-based deterministic inversion of geophysical data with Generative Adversarial Networks: is it feasible?

This is the companion code of the paper by Laloy et al. (see reference below). This Python 3 package contains the 
used pytorch-written GAN together with the tested two deterministic inversion strategies for the considered linear 
ground penetrating radar (GPR) tomography problem.
